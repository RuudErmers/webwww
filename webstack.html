                <p>Ermers Consultancy was asked to give an overview over modern
                  technologies used in Full Webstack development. In the past
                  Ruud Ermers worked privately on a multimedia system and this
                  served as a case for this assignment. In the following I
                  present, in short, the multimedia system and several ways to
                  connect this system to the outside (and inside) world.
                  Technologies discussed will be back-end development in Object
                  Pascal, C# and Javascript and frontend develpment in C#
                  (Xamarin), javascript, typescript and java (Android). Also
                  considered are desktop implementations in various
                  technologies.</p>
                <h1 class="entry-title">The system: A multimedia system </h1>
                <p>The multimedia system consists of a multi-room audio system.
                  The system is running on one PC, with 4 internal audiocards
                  which serve audio to various rooms. Moreover, with extra
                  Android clients this can be extended to an unlimited number of
                  audio clients. There is a number of host applications which
                  enable this system: There are audioplayers which can play
                  audio over one or more audio cards, there are audiobrowsers
                  with which you can browse the audio collection (hosted on a
                  local harddrive). The system can play individual audio in each
                  room, but they can also be synchronized. Lastly, there is a
                  http-server interface which can control the various options
                  for all attached audioplayers, like pausing, exposing the
                  mediafiles, selecting an audiofile or audiofolder. </p>
                <p>In this case study, the most important interface is the
                  http-server, which was written in Delphi a long time ago, but
                  is still maintained (e.g. to serve JSON data besides XML). It
                  listens on an internal port and can not be reached from the
                  web.</p>
                <h1 class="entry-title">The back-end: Webserver choices.</h1>
                <p><br>
                </p>
                <p>The webserver needed for the full systems has the following
                  requirements: It should implement Virtual Paths, should be
                  able to forward requests to another server and serve requests
                  doing some scripting. Of course, things like security, speed,
                  maintainability are a must.</p>
                <p>I have implemented three different webserver technologies,
                  i.e. Abyss Web server, Node.js and ASP.Net Core. </p>

                    <p><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Droid Serif&quot;,Georgia,serif;">For
                          this case study, Abyss webserver is not very
                          interesting. It is a very robust webserver, with
                          Virtual Paths, security and many options, configurable
                          from a web interface. I used this in the past, to
                          connect my multimedia-server directly to the webserver
                          using FAST-CGI. At one point I decided to have a
                          programmable server instead of a configurable server.
                          Nevertheless, an interesting product.</span></span></p>

                    <p><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Droid Serif&quot;,Georgia,serif;">Node.js
                          is a popular webserver technology. Development is done
                          in Javascript, not my favorite language. Setup is very
                          easy. Development can be done from Visual Studio with
                          full intellisense. After the first strugglings,
                          Node.js turns out to be a very easy to use
                          environment.During development the server can be
                          stopped and started quickly, giving very short
                          development cycles. In fact, Node.js is my choice for
                          the webserver.</span></span></p>

                    <p><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Droid Serif&quot;,Georgia,serif;">I
                          only touched this technology from the surface. The
                          great advantage of ASP.NET Core over Node.js is that
                          development can be done in C#. This is a big plus over
                          Node.js Javascript. Setup is also very easy and
                          development can be done from Visual Studio as well.
                          You can also develop from Visual Code. As I only did
                          some basic research, I struggle to get things going.
                          On the internet there is quite some help, but many
                          examples refer not to the latest technology. I find
                          the Microsoft documentation, although very thorough,
                          difficult to read, without many examples. Cross domain
                          policies have been better addressed than in Node.js,
                          so security (as stated by the developers) is an
                          important plus. <br>

                <p><br>
                </p>
                <p>First off, I am not a designer and i don't like HTML and CSS.
                  Therefor, I am still looking for client technologies which go
                  beyond that. Moreover, you will not be impressed by my user
                  interfaces. Here is one from a jquery frontend: </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/remoteweb.jpg"
                    alt="" style="width: 457px; height: 319px;"></div>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
                </div>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>For the frontend, the above picture will be the target to
                      implement. We can see some selections icons, a picture
                      from the current album (in the Ruud's room), see the
                      tracks, volume and some more. Many are clickable, e.g. to
                      select a track, or another room. You can also browse the
                      collection. Remember that the back-end will serve the
                      needed data (model) to generate the view. Since the view
                      changes every second, many requests to the server are
                      fired. The communication protocol is pretty much REST
                      based (but was allready established years ago, using a
                      mapping to classes) and served in JSON format. So let's
                      discuss some webtechnologies on how to implement this, and
                      take a look at some other technologies for remote
                      control&nbsp; (phone, table) as well. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>Before continuing, I will investigate on client side
                    technologies only. We see a clear drifting away from e.g.
                    ASP.NET where there is a lot of interaction between the
                    (dedicated) server and the webclient. (e.g. every click is
                    forwarded to the server, maintaining a 'viewbag' state for
                    each client).</li>

                          JQuery is used to make web design easier. It abstracts
                          away browser incompatibilities and gives us an easier
                          to use javascript framework, with, amongst other
                          things, an easy AJAX implementation. With jquery it
                          becomes easier to split web development between
                          javascript designers and UI (HTML/CSS) designers.
                          Since I am not a UI designer,&nbsp; I embraced Jquery,
                          as many others did. However, it is still javascript
                          development, and for OO-designers there is still a lot
                          to wish for.</span></span></p>

                          4 (or 5) is a framework for client side
                          webdevelopment. It uses Typescript as language instead
                          of javascript and comes with full support for testing,
                          debugging, easy maintenance. With Typescript, you
                          finally have a (limited) OO language to develop with.
                          The learning curve for Angular is somewhat steep,
                          although there are some really good tutorials to get
                          you going. The framework implements MVC (or 'even'
                          MVVM) and separates UI design and OO development much
                          better than e.g. JQuery. The development cycle is very
                          short: Changes in your code are almost immediately
                          reflected in the browser. That's nice. Still, there
                          are some things missing. Typescript just isn't a full
                          fledged OO language and somehow you still feel that it
                          is just a javascript wrapper technology. I was
                          surprised when I found out that you can't just run an
                          Angular site from a webserver, but first have to build
                          your project into a /dist distribution.&nbsp; This
                          leaves the question why there still not is a platform
                          to do C# development.</span></span></p>

                    my remote example in Delphi, C# WinForms, C# Wpf. I will
                    also skip development for IOS, because, I am sorry to say, I
                    am not interested in anything that is Apple - related (I
                    once had an I-pod, but it was running Rockbox). So that

                          development has come a long way since the early days
                          where you had to code in Eclipse, define all your UIs
                          with XML and ADB bridge was still 'in development'. I
                          was pleasantly surprised some time ago when upgrading
                          to Android Studio 3. Although downloading and
                          installing takes ages (but is still faster than Visual
                          Studio Installer), converting my old remote control
                          project worked smoothly. Moreover, the IDE is very
                          nice to use, and comes close to Visual Studio. I hope
                          my days with struggling with Eclipse are finally over.
                          Also, with JAVA 8, Android makes it possible to use
                          lambda functions, which is nice to have for
                          asynchronous http requests. The debugger is very
                          reliable and so is ADB. There is also a GUI designer,
                          making development comparable with desktop
                          development. For new developers (with a background in
                          HTML/CSS) I think JAVA/Android is still a steep
                          mountain to climb, but for people with a OO background
                          it will be very familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                          Xamarin you can build C# applications, targeting UWP,
                          IOS and Android. Xamarin is available in Visual Studio
                          as a plugin. I have build a few applications in
                          Xamarin, also for customers. Although it all sounds
                          very promising, and is an adventure in its own, I am
                          not convinced this is the way to go. As a C#
                          programmer I like the fact I can code in that language
                          and re-use a lot of code, and the integration with
                          Android is really first class. But Xamarin is still
                          missing a good Form designer, so I had to create the
                          full user interface from code. Furthermore, execution
                          speed is just low compared to native development and
                          although debugging is possible, I had a lot of issues,
                          with many different tablets/phones. Not recommended
                          for Android development.<br>
